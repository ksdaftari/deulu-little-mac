Get up and running with MyST in Jupyter!
:::


- ledgetrapping (eg ledgemaker)
   - distances of rolling from ledge on ach stage 
   - frames of get up attack
   - set ups (what they take away/cover, look at trumpets SL example)
- ledge gaurding
- On stage recovery (fast fall neutral air dodge)

- blog with my training regiment (as talking about different ways to train)
- each week, what is plan, what have learned

- nair for getting out of tumble 

- movement guide (gtad youtube link)

- add yoshi on shield

- ways to get KO punch (whiff, uptilt reverse KO, etc)
    - how to evade KO punch (so know how to whiff punish)

- combos (flow chart)
- recovery image 

- ?should i distingisuh KO Kill Percent between ground vs plat and type of stage 
- ?should percentage include color (so have the visual)

- up B kill percents 
- shield break 

- MU & mac
    - on shield (what safe, nothing, but eg up smash will avoid grab)
    - what does MU want to do out of shield? 
    - what MU safe on shield? 

- why use differnet moves (eg why/when to use dash attack and when not)
- training tips (eg how to train KO punch, trainign mod, settings - eg stale/etc

- kill confirms

- dtilt ledge flow chart (depending when need another dtilt, when should ftilt vs side B)

- what can SL armour through vs not for each MU

- review replays for things to do

- improvement log:
    - what are you consistenly loosing to:
        - projectiles
        - spam
        - choosing random smash attacks that miss (vs optimal one for coverage)
    - what is counter measure?

- mu burst range (explain range based on small battlefield visuals)


- getting started 
    - controller settings/layout

- create specific youtube playlist per notable players
- do double dair instead of dair jab for platform lock

- get up from ledge (full hop SL for ZSS neutral B)

- roll canceled grab (as long as tethered samus)

- general smash knowledge section (eg visual queues of DI, tumble, how long tumble lasts, etc)

- shield hitbox shift (eg uptilt, up smash)

- file with map stats (height, blast zone), categorize plats as low, mid, high. also which ones good for mac and why 
    - nice to see what ways to use Kalos plats 

- Neutral jing is stated to be the key to earthbending. Fundamentally, neutral jing involves listening, though seemingly doing nothing, and waiting for the right moment to strike.

- add to noteable player playlist ones link to smash tube (as will be mots up to date https://smash-tube.com/en/result.php?player1=Peanut&character1=%E3%83%AA%E3%83%88%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BB%E3%83%9E%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF&player2=&character2=&free_word=&region=&submit=#result)
  - change perhaps my youtube collections to be ones have actually reviewed and deemed useful (did vod review on)
  - do similar for match up
  - my vods list are more to augment
- document resources per character like their documents, youtubers, etc, so easily have 
resources to learn those characters indepth
- summarize the smash mechanics and engine. detailed section along with snapshot (key points that many dont know or forget)
- create database/python package so can easily analyze SBBU data which will allow
  - link all data together (stage positions, character frame data). and take findings on specific MU and specific characteristics
  of mac and use that, to do things on aggregate across cast? 
  - understand aggregate characteristics of cast (min/max)
  - try different data analysis visuals to see if notice patterns (eg are there better aggregate measures like median vs mean that more helpful to use)
  - how can i use this for more general base gameplan
  - how can start to categorize MUs
  - scripts that can answer certain questions
  - see if can recreate findings from data analysis (to perhaps even lead to ways to find more findings)
- Start to document practical ways to understand frames, what psychological (eg decision making time, reaction time),
    - in this start to see if can test what my general reaction speed is (get some personal data), so understand what
    realistic for me
    - what some heuristics that if here have X frame advantage, lag, etc what that means what practical can do 
        - when something reactable vs need anticipate vs need to buffer
        - use that youtube video on reaction vs anticipate (and what that means for inputs)
        - what does it mean "That move is unreactable"
        - how modify all this when think of online
