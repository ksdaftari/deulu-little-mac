% TODO: see if want breakdowns per weight class (heavyweight vs light weight, etc)
% TODO: visual/practical description of tech roll distnace (as not consistent for cast) https://discord.com/channels/232987534588641281/520847397404934145/1413331062058389616
% TODO: see if want to add kill percents per plat type (given tech roll read to KO punch is really easy on plat, same reason uptilt up B easy one), i guess there would have to be consistent low percent move to cause tech for plat for this to be viable. knowing at least what is earliest percent to cause tech on plat is helpful
% TODO: add framedata link for each character
