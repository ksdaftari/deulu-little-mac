# 2025-10-22 Strategy

## Overview

In this post I explore how to understand how to come up with concrete strategy

To make this tangeible we will need to:
1. Document basic mechanics of the game
2. Pick specific MU and stage to breakdown
3. See how can generalize

For this we will take [Lucas](lucas) on [Small Battlefield](small_battlefield)

## Basic Game Mechanics

1. hitstun (what is actionable, and when able vs not)?
2. tumble (what is actionalbe, what is fastest action, how long last)?
3. shield and oos options (frame data, eg up smash no shield drop, etc)
4. document LSI vs DI (only horizontal) vs SDI? using away and up for tech situations, etc
5. when squat jump vs double jump frames? 
6. frame calculs like in mii sword fighter vod

Understanding frame data:
1. 6 frames of input delay imposed by SSBU engine
2. fastest reaction time = 12 frames, average = 15 frames
3. OOS options have 11frames of shield drop delay, no delay for jump, grab, up smash, up special. 
4. any 50/50 or decsion (ie not reaction) takes 10 frames (Hicks law)

Full frame and stats for each MU: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Is8rHLPiFtvlj2t8kV5iy21-wIBidDW7bFYMzx6eJIU/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

### Methodology

This describes how lab & practice (how use and what settings use in training mod)


### Practice

We will describe how to practice:
1. SDI
2. DI (DI shift for Kaz)
3. Tech Plat
4. Tech Edge 
5. Tech Spiking
6. Mashing out of grab
7. KO punch (gazelle, reverse KO punch, etc)

## Vod Review

### Alternis vs Shisui

1. Lucas easily hurtbox shifts under side B (do not use side B unless confirm, if burst option will whiff)

% TODO: document how long distance takes to travel with dash and/or jog, to specific land marks. 
% TODO: understand exact movement needed and spacing based that is intuitive (eg length of plat, mid plat, single dash distnace, dinstace needed for atack hit box)
% TODO: for MU what hitbox shifts will get hit (eg icin if forward smash you will get caught by side B vs if not can easily space out)
% TODO: detail understanding of macs spacing, frames, etc in intutive way
% TODO: MU sphere of threat/attack
% TODO: diagram of what can edge gaurd off ledge so know where safe to recover
% TODO: distance and spacign from ledge that snap when up B (vs get clipped)
% TODO: understanding what fastest options are across cast (so can derive things like why mac hits on shield are usually unsafe, need to know slowest out of shield options for example)
% TODO: understand use of dash and squat hurtbox shifting (what can evade, eg yoshi out of shield options not hitting if squat after attack)
% TODO: document combos and which percentages true at
% TODO: undestand how shield stun affects ability to react. What to do with calculated frame advantage/disadvantage
% TODO: understanding what attack and what percents cause tech situation (plat vs ground tech)
% TODO: understanding super armour vs heavy amrour. what does it take to break it? does it deplete or need certain attack of certain damagee?
% TODO: making sure practical responses (Eg if situation usually would have rage or not, eg this influences practical range that dtilt Ko confirm happens)
% TODO: translating practcially what 3 frames of reaction really means
% TODO: specific vods and breakdown for Lucas MU (other top macs vs Lucas)
% TODO: breaking down frames and reasoning like dash dancing vs just standing still/walking puts in less advantages position (think of it as just X extra lag put on character, eg how fast can react with shield, how fast can dash back/evade/turn around, etc). this gets to movement and attacks that "safe"/"spammable" vs unsafe and only used with specific intention (eg contray to general opinion mac should jog & titlt vs dash & smash attack frequently)
% TODO: how to get up B kill confrims, when should uptilt, when should idj, how respond to DI, etc
% TODO: know difference when advantages to uptilt vs reverse uptilt (lots of top macs will switch in uptilt combo intentional for specific follow up - why is this?)
% TODO: need to figure how to condense the notes of strategy that is actual manageable to remember/implement in game. This comes down (a) what general base bread and butter strategy is as mac, that have down without thinking (b) a small condensed report of adjustments/highlights that enahnce that base strategy
% TODO: describe what i want my flavor of playstyle. Consistent, patient, large use of grabs to promote other options, anticipation, patterns that key in on - what is worth noting vs not (ie what can mac get mileage out of), strive is to the most minimal amount of inputs to win (efficency and let oppoent beat themselves) 
% TODO: review notes from smasher1001 on discord, and this controller https://handheldlegend.com/products/progcc-kit-wireless-wired-bundle (has octognoal gate settings)
% TODO: understand movement distance (eg single dash input dashes length of plat), frames to travel, and lag between ending dash (to atttack, to shield). A use case would be looking at min min what distances do you actually have ability to attack vs not. ALso for ledge trapping, if you were dtilting, what are inputs to get once quarter of plat or second half of plat accurately so can catch landing with up smash. 
% TODO: log and understand dash and pivot dash frames https://www.ssbwiki.com/Dash (that plus visually how far dash covers can help understand what follow ups are possible)

### Practice Plan

1. Trade dash dancing habit for pivot dancing. It practice micro movement and still can frame 1 shield easily (And also looks funny lol)
2. Move back to patient play, when in doubt dont move or touch controls. This mixed with micro movevement should see whiff KO punches go back up
3. dtilt/uptilt and read habit to see how respond
4. dash then walk right out of burst range, similar with pivot cancel ftilt, you react/start this too late

### Observations

Mac 
1. using foxtrot, it takes 4 flicks dash to cross stage, you get to each quadrent, end of stage, middle of plat, mid stage, other mid plat, end of stage. 
2. mid plat doesnt have many good follow up attacks (up air, and up smash need to be mid quarters on side of opponent to hit reliablely)
3. learnign turn around up smash, could help with an easy specific spacing of ledge options to then do follow up plat land read
4. 

Lucas
1. from ledge, jump can cover entire stage
2. can airdodge as close to mid hieght (not far from plat), and react directional airdodge that will cover distance to other plat
