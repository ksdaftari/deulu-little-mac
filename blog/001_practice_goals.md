# Initial Goals

## Improve Techinical Foundation

After playing game seriously around 6 months, I want to take step back and look back at fundamentals, especially techinically. This is because:

1. Feeling limited in my options I have to follow up properly on habits notice from opponent
2. For options do know, easily mispace and whiff
3. Lack of efficient movement to get to spot in time to follow up (eg properly follow when tech on high plat)
4. Many times misinput or auto pilot follow up instead based on reaction for example:
    1. If dtilt and opponent shields, i will still side B automatically
    2. Tech chase I have pretemined follow up instead of react or not know what properly follow up giving spacing/distance

I am getting to point where am starting to be able to read opponent, but cannot follow up properly. Which is starting to lead to frustration, and there are some "flair" other macs have that would like to add (even if just for fun)

To do this more specifically I am going to work on:

1. Chaning controller scheme (see chart below). Controller scheme I look to optomize
    1. Ability to easily use movement stick and tilt stick for ariels -> need shoulder button to be jump
    2. Reduce reliance on finesse movements
        1. Easy short hops with two jump button macro (instead of quick touch of jump button)
        2. Use of Tilt stick 
    3. Button layout that keeps hands largely stationary and doesnt require . My resting position being:
        1. Both index fingers resting on both rear buttons
        2. Both thumbs resting on control sticks
    4. Ability to easily "shield shift" via two shield button macro

## Improve Knowledge Foundation

To start my journey on documenting and sythensizing my learnings of smash and Mac. I want to first by starting with documenting some of the basic foundations of smash ultimate, the universal items, base frame data/options should know, etc.

There is lot of basics/unirversal techiniques people don't know, that will be hard to build any additional knowledge without understanding these fundamentals

This includes items like: 

1. OOS shield lag 
2. Dash/running lag and techinques
3. Instant shield on dash
4. Buffer tech on up B

## Automation Foundation

As fun part of this project, I want to start to gather data that is easily programmatically analyzed. There are certain portion of docs, especially MU portions that want via excel spreadsheet (ie polars dataframes):

1. to automate generation portions of MU page
2. re-use information to summarize in "Resource" section for example
